This is the online repository for the Data Management Plan of the LaSSO 2021 research project proposal.

Shown below: Locations of the 25 shoreline study areas used to collect samples of geo-raster data around Marsh Island over time to capture shoreline dynamics. Each study area is 109 pixels (width) by 100 pixels (height). Given that each geo-raster pixel is 30m x 30 m, each study area covers 3,270 meters by 3,000 meters. Data preparation starts with the 4-5-3 raster signal bands (A) that are used in a classification algorithm with the SCP plug-in in QGIS to classify each pixel as either land or water (B). This particular sample geo-raster dataset is the baseline date of 26 January 1985, which is the earliest high-quality Landsat dataset available.
